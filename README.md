## Abstract
The nuclear pore complex presents different composition along eukaryotes, with even some components being restricted to specific taxonomic clades. Several studies have been conducted to delineate the nuclear pore complex composition in various organisms. Due to its pivotal role in the cellâ€™s viability, traditional lab experiments, such as gene knockdowns, can prove inconclusive thus creating the need of a complementary, high-quality computational process necessary. Here, using an extensive data collection, we create a robust library of nucleoporin protein sequences and their respective family-specific position-specific scoring matrices. Importantly, by extensively validating each profile in different settings, we propose that the created profiles can be used to detect nucleoporins in proteomes with high sensitivity and specificity, in par or even better compared to existing methods. We make the library of profiles and the underlying sequence data openly available to assist interested researchers detect nucleoporins in their datasets of interest and to computational biologists to build upon and/or improve these models.
