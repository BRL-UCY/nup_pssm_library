## Nucleoporin sequences

Here we provide our carefully curated library of nucleoporin sequences segmented by nucleoporin family. The sequences are provided both [masked](./masked/) and [unmasked](./unmasked/). Sequence masking was performed using CAST[^1] with threshold 15.

The sequences were collected using PSI-BLAST with the runs reported herein were performed September to December 2019, using the non-redundant protein database (nr) and the Entrez Query “NOT fragment NOT partial”.
