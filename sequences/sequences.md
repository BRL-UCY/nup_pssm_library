Library of masked & unmasked nucleoporin sequences.


It should be noted that the sequence for NUP54 from S. cerevisiae str. FostersO contained the ambiguous aminoacid J (Xle â€“ leucine or isoleucine) at positions 191 and 481. Since some sequence analysis software do not accept ambiguous amino acid types they were changed to L (leucine) and I (isoleucine) respectively, according to the NUP54 sequence from the sister taxon S. cerevisiae str. FostersB.
